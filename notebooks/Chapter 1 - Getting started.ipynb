Loops make it possible to perform a certain action on a range of elements. For example, given a list of words, we would like to know the length of all words, not just one. Now you *could* do this by going through all the indices of a list of words and print the length of the words one at a time, taking up as many lines of code as you have indices. Needless to say, this is rather cumbersome. What's more, if we don't know length of the list of words in advance, this strategy doesn't even work.\n",
