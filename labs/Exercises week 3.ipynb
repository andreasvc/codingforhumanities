    "   Your task in this exercise is to define a function `make_3sg_form()` which given a verb in infinitive form returns its third person singular form. Test your function with words like try, brush, run and fix. Note however that the rules must be regarded as heuristic, in the sense that you must not expect them to work for all cases. Tip: Check out the string method [.endswith()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.endswith)."

Check out the documentation of [.split()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) for helpful optional parameters.\n",
