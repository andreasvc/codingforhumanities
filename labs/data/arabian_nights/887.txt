She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir bade imprison Nur al-Din, they carried him to the stables and left him there in chains, hungering and thirsting and making moan for himself; for indeed he saw death face to face. Now it fortuned, by the ordinance of Destiny and fore-ordained Fate, that the King had two stallions, own brothers, such as the Chosroe Kings might sigh in vain to possess themselves of one of them; they were called Sabik and Lahik and one of them was pure silvern white while the other was black as the darksome night. And all the Kings of the isles had said, "Whoso stealeth us one of these stallions, we will give him all he seeketh of red gold and pearls and gems;" but none could avail to steal them. Now one of them fell sick of a jaundice and there came a whiteness over his eyes; whereupon the King gathered together all the farriers in the city to treat him; but they all failed of his cure. Presently the Wazir came into the King; and finding him troubled because of the horse, thought to do away his concern and said to him, "O King, give me the stallion and I will cure him," The King consented and caused carry the horse to the stable wherein Nur al-Din lay chained; but, when he missed his brother, he cried out with an exceeding great cry and neighed, so that he affrighted all the folk. The Wazir, seeing that he did thus but because he was parted from his brother, went to tell the King, who said, "If this, which is but a beast, cannot brook to be parted from his brother, how should it be with those that have reason?" And he bade his grooms take the other horse and put him with his brother in the Wazir's stables, saying, "Tell the Minister that the two stallions be a gift from me to him, for the sake of my daughter Miriam." Nur al-Din was lying in the stable, chained and shackled, when they brought in the two stallions and he saw that one of them had a film over his eyes. Now he had some knowledge of horses and of the doctoring of their diseases; so he said to himself, "This by Allah is my opportunity! I will go to the Wazir and lie to him, saying, 'I will heal thee this horse': then will I do with him somewhat that shall destroy his eyes, and he will slay me and I shall be at rest from this woe-full life." So he waited till the Wazir entered the stable, to look upon the steed, and said to him, "O my lord, what will be my due, an I heal this horse, and make his eyes whole again?" Replied the Wazir, "As my head liveth, an thou cure him, I will spare thy life and give thee leave to crave a boon of me!" And Nur al-Din said, "O my lord, bid my hands be unbound!" So the Wazir bade unbind him and he rose and taking virgin glass, brayed it and mixed it with unslaked lime and a menstruum of onion-juice. Then he applied the whole to the horse's eyes and bound them up, saying in himself, "Now will his eyes be put out and they will slay me and I shall be at rest from this woe-full life." Then he passed the night with a heart free from the uncertainty of cark and care, humbling himself to Allah the Most High and saying, "O Lord, in Thy knowledge is that which dispenseth with asking and craving!" Now when the morning morrowed and the sun shone, the Wazir came to the stable and, loosing the bandage from the horse's eyes considered them and found them finer than before, by the ordinance of the King who openeth evermore. So he said to Nur al-Din, "O Moslem, never in the world saw I the like of thee for the excellence of thy knowledge. By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou makest me with wonder to admire, for all the farriers of our land have failed to heal this horse!" Then he went up to Nur al-Din and, doing off his shackles with his own hand, clad him in a costly dress and made him his master of the Horse; and he appointed him stipends and allowances and lodged him in a story over the stables. So Nur al-Din abode awhile, eating and drinking and making merry and bidding and forbidding those who tended the horses; and whoso neglected or failed to fodder those tied up in the stable wherein was his service, he would thrown down and beat with grievous beating and lay him by the legs in bilboes of iron. Furthermore, he used every day to descend and visit the stallions and rub them down with his own hand, by reason of that which he knew of their value in the Wazir's eyes and his love for them; wherefore the Minister rejoiced in him with joy exceeding and his breast broadened and he was right glad, unknowing what was to be the issue of his case. Now in the new palace, which the one-eyed Wazir had bought for Princess Miriam, was a lattice-window overlooking his old house and the flat wherein Nur al-Din lodged. The Wazir had a daughter, a virgin of extreme loveliness, as she were a fleeing gazelle or a bending branchlet, and it chanced that she sat one day at the lattice aforesaid and behold, she heard Nur al-Din, singing and solacing himself under his sorrows by improvising these verses, 
"O my Censor who wakest a-morn to see * The joys of life and its jubilee!  
 Had the fangs of Destiny bitten thee * In such bitter case thou hadst pled this plea,  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 But from Fate's despight thou art safe this day;- * From her falsest fay and her crying 'Nay!'  
 Yet blame him not whom his woes waylay * Who distraught shall say in his agony,  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 Excuse such lovers in flight abhorr'd * Nor to Love's distreses thine aid afford:  
 Lest thy self be bound by same binding cord * And drink of Love's bitterest injury.  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 In His service I wont as the days went by * With freest heart through the nights to lie;  
 Nor tasted wake, nor of Love aught reckt * Ere my heart to subjection summoned he:  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 None weet of Love and his humbling wrong * Save those he sickened so sore, so long,  
 Who have lost their wits 'mid the lover-throng * Draining bitterest cup by his hard decree:  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 How oft in Night's gloom he cause wake to rue * Lovers' eyne, and from eyelids their sleep withdrew;  
 Till tears to the railing of torrents grew, * Overflowing cheeks , unconfined and free:  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 How many a man he has joyed to steep * In pain, and for pine hath he plundered sleep,--  
 Made don garb of mourning the deepest deep * And even his dreaming forced to flee:  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 How oft sufferance fails me! How bones are wasted * And down my cheeks torrent tear-drops hasted:  
 And embittered She all the food I tasted * However sweet it was wont to be:  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 Most hapless of men who like me must love, * And must watch when Night droops her wing from above,  
 Who, swimming the main where affection drove * Must sign and sink in that gloomy sea:  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 Who is he to whom Love e'er stinted spite * And who scaped his springes and easy sleight;  
 Who free from Love lived in life's delight? * Where is he can boast of such liberty?  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'  
 Deign Lord such suffering wight maintain * Then best Protector, protect him deign!  
 Establish him and his life assain * And defend him from all calamity:  
 'Ah me, for Love and his case, ah me: My heart is burnt by the fires I dree!'"
And when Nur al-Din ended his say and ceased to sing his rhyming lay, the Wazir's daughter said to herself, "By the virtue of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, verily this Moslem is a handsome youth! But doubtless he is a lover separated from his mistress. Would Heaven I wot an the beloved of this fair one is fair like unto him and if she pine for him as he for her! An she be seemly as he is, it behoveth him to pour forth tears and make moan of passion; but, an she be other than fair, his days are wasted in vain regrets and he is denied the taste of delights."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
