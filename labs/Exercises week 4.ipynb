You do not need to tokenize the file. A substring can match any part of the string, including multiple words or parts of words. Make the search case-insensitive."

A *hapax legomenon* (often abbreviated to hapax) is a word which occurs only once (i.e., has a frequency of 1) in either the written record of a language, the works of an author, or in a single text. Define a function `hapax(filename)` that reads the file and returns all its hapaxes as a list. Make sure your program ignores capitalization and punctuation using functions defined in the Chapter 3 notebook."

Write a function `avg_word_len(filnema)` that will calculate the average word length in a text stored in a file (i.e., the sum of all the lengths of the word tokens in the text, divided by the number of word tokens). Apply it to a couple of books and compare them. Re-use the functions for preprocessing from the previous question."
